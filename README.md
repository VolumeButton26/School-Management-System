# PORT
Port is a Learning Management Application designed with a focus on simplicity.

This is a prototype submission by Group 9 for the end-term project of the course CC106: Cloud-based Application Development.

Note: For sample data, you can import the sql file found in the "db" folder into your own sql server under a database named "school_management_db".
